Customize our own TextView may be better: CustomTextView.java

MyViewerOne.java: a very raw and full-of-bugs view

Maybe the best way to padding character type text is to not use padding, but simply assign all characters, even a space included, fixed width, which is very easy to implemented and good for performance
